Whenever you make any changes to the database models, you will need to generate a new Alembic \"revision\". You can use the bin/db-revision.sh script to help create a new revision after you've made some changes to the database models: bin/db-revision.sh \"Some short note\" This script uses Alembic's \"autogenerate\" feature to create what it thinks is the correct database migration script for the changes you made.

The migration scripts can be found in backend/db/migrations/versions/ .
